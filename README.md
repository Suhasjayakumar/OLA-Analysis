## **SQL Queries for Data Analysis**

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Retrieve all successful bookings**  
```sql
SELECT * FROM bookings  
WHERE Booking_Status = 'success';
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Find the average ride distance for each vehicle type**  
```sql
SELECT Vehicle_Type, AVG(Ride_Distance) AS average_distance  
FROM bookings  
GROUP BY Vehicle_Type;
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Get the total number of rides canceled by customers**  
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS cancelled_rides  
FROM bookings  
WHERE Booking_Status = 'Cancelled by Customer';
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **List the top 5 customers who booked the highest number of rides**  
```sql
SELECT Customer_ID, COUNT(*) AS total_rides  
FROM bookings  
GROUP BY Customer_ID  
ORDER BY total_rides DESC  
LIMIT 5;
```

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Get the number of rides canceled by drivers due to personal and car-related issues**  
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS cancelled  
FROM bookings  
WHERE `Reason_for_cancelling by Driver` = 'Personal & car related issues';
```

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ **Find the maximum and minimum driver ratings for Prime Sedan bookings**  
```sql
SELECT MAX(Driver_Ratings) AS maximum, MIN(Driver_Ratings) AS minimum  
FROM bookings  
WHERE Vehicle_Type = 'Prime Sedan';
```

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ **Retrieve all rides where payment was made using UPI**  
```sql
SELECT * FROM bookings  
WHERE Payment_Method = 'UPI';
```

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ **Find the average customer rating per vehicle type**  
```sql
SELECT Vehicle_Type, AVG(Customer_Rating) AS avg_customer_rating  
FROM bookings  
GROUP BY Vehicle_Type;
```

### 9Ô∏è‚É£ **Calculate the total booking value of rides completed successfully**  
```sql
SELECT SUM(Booking_value) AS total_booking_value  
FROM bookings  
WHERE Booking_Status = 'success';
```

### üîü **List all incomplete rides along with the reason**  
```sql
SELECT Booking_ID, Incomplete_Rides_Reason  
FROM bookings  
WHERE Booking_Status != 'success';
```

## **DAX Measures for Power BI**

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Average Driver Rating**  
```DAX
AverageDriverRating =  
AVERAGE (Bangalore_Booking_Data[Driver_Ratings])
```

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Handling Errors in Driver Ratings Calculation**  
```DAX
AverageDriverRating =  
AVERAGEX (Bangalore_Booking_Data, IFERROR(VALUE(Bangalore_Booking_Data[Driver_Ratings]), 0))
```
